= Microprofile Showcase Application

== General information

The application consists of several Microservices and a Web-Application managing a conference :

* `microservice-schedule` : Schedule of the conference
* `microservice-session` : Sessions of the conference
* `microservice-speaker` : Speakers of the conference
* `microservice-vote` : Votes for each session
* `web-application` : Frontend Angular2 | Bootstrap4

The WebApp is a direct subscriber to the individual Microservices.
This means that there is no aggregator / middle-man application.
The WebApp itself provides a known relative EndPoint microservice that enables the lookup of
URLs to the other services.

== Technologies

* Java
* Micro Profile
* JAX-RS 2.0 / JSON-P 1.0 / CDI 1.1

== Quickstart - Run all services and UI in separate runtimes

This will run each service in the runtime container that its setup for and the UI in a Node.js server to interact with them.

Build, package and run all microservices and the UI:

----
mvn clean package -P start,ui
----

Run just the microservices:

----
mvn package -Pstart -pl :microservice-start
----

Run just the UI:

----
mvn package -Pui -pl :microservice-start
----

=== Running on Liberty

To run all the services on individual WebSphere Liberty servers add the 'liberty' profile to the command:

----
mvn clean package -P start,ui,liberty
----

----
mvn package -P start,liberty -pl :microservice-start
----

== Development Build

----
mvn clean install -DskipTests
----

* Build the projects using Maven (`mvn clean install`) or (`mvn -fn clean install`) to skip over failed tests.
* To get the technical documentation, just `mvn clean generate-resources` under the `docs` directory.
You will find a PDF and HTML version of the documentation under `docs/target/generated-docs`

== Development Tests

mvn clean test

== Run Individual Services

Each service can run on any container (this is the Microprofile guarantee),
but the service projects have been written by vendors to use their container.

The following sections describe vendor specifics:

=== microservice-schedule
The Schedule service is provided using a special microprofile release of link:http://www.payara.fish/payara_micro[Payara Micro] which can be downloaded from link:http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22payara-microprofile%22[Maven Central]

*Build and run the service*
When building the service Payara Microprofile packages both the war file and the microprofile runtime into a single UberJar for convenience.
```
cd microservice-schedule
mvn clean package
java -jar target\microservice-schedule.jar --port 6060
```

*Port Bindings*
By default the microservice would bind to port 8080, if this is not available it will bind to the next available port e.g. 8081. Specifying the port using --port as a command line option overrides this.

To verify that the schedule microservice is running, use the following link: http://localhost:6060/schedule/all

To see a full set options run the jar with the --help command line option or see the link:https://payara.gitbooks.io/payara-server/content/documentation/payara-micro/payara-micro.html[Payara Micro Documentation] for a full list of options.

==== Running on Liberty

Alternatively you can run this service on liberty by doing:

```
cd microservice-schedule
mvn -Pliberty package
java -jar target/microservice-schedule-liberty.jar
```
=== microservice-schedule-kumuluzee
Provided using link:https://ee.kumuluz.com/[KumuluzEE 2.4.1]

*Build and run the service*
```
cd microservice-schedule-kumuluzee
mvn clean package
java [-D<OPTION>] -jar target/microservice-schedule-kumuluzee.jar
```

*Address & Port Bindings*

.Session Service Options
|===
|Flag |Description| Default

| kumuluzee.server.http.address=<address>
| HTTP bind interface
| 0.0.0.0

| kumuluzee.server.http.port=<port>
| HTTP port
| 8080
|===

For example, if you want to change the HTTP port to 8000, run the application like this:

----
java -Dkumuluzee.server.http.port=8000 -jar target/microservice-session-kumuluzee.jar
----

Click on this link to verify that everything ran fine: http://localhost:8000/schedule

=== microservice-session

Provided using link:http://wildfly-swarm.io[WildFly Swarm]

*Build and run the service*
```
cd microservice-session
mvn clean package
java -jar target/microservice-session-swarm.jar [-D<OPTION>]
```

*Address & Port Bindings*

.Session Service Options
|===
|Flag |Description| Default

| swarm.bind.address=<address>
| Interface to bind servers
| 0.0.0.0

| swarm.http.port=<port>
| Sets the port for the HTTP server
| 8080

| swarm.port.offset=<offset>
| Sets a global port adjustment
| 0
|===

For example, if you want to change the HTTP port to 5050, run the application like this:

----
java -jar target/microservice-session-swarm.jar -Dswarm.http.port=5050
----

Click on this link to verify that everything ran fine: http://localhost:5050/sessions

For a full set of configuration options please see link:https://wildfly-swarm.gitbooks.io/wildfly-swarm-users-guide/content/[the Wildfly Swarm Userguide]

==== Running on Liberty

Alternatively you can run this service on liberty by doing:

```
cd microservice-session
mvn -Pliberty package
java -jar target/microservice-session-liberty.jar
```

=== microservice-speaker
Provided using link:http://tomee.apache.org/[Apache TomEE 7.x]

*Build and run the service*
[source,sh]
----
cd microservice-speaker

mvn clean package

java -jar target/microservice-speaker-exec.jar
----

If you look at the output, you will find messages like the following:

----
INFO - REST Application: http://localhost:4040/speaker               -> io.microprofile.showcase.speaker.rest.Application@68cda174
INFO - Service URI: http://localhost:4040/speaker/              -> Pojo io.microprofile.showcase.speaker.rest.ResourceSpeaker
INFO - DELETE http://localhost:4040/speaker/remove/{id}   ->      void remove(String)
----

There you can see the URLs of the endpoints exposed by TomEE for your application.

To verify that everything worked fine, you can try to access http://localhost:4040/speaker

==== Running on Liberty

Alternatively you can run this service on liberty by doing:

```
cd microservice-speaker
mvn -Pliberty package
java -jar target/microservice-speaker-liberty.jar
```


=== microservice-vote
Provided using link:https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/[WebSphere Liberty]

*Build and run the service*
```
cd microservice-vote
mvn package
java -jar target/microservice-vote.jar
```

Access the app at http://localhost:7070/vote

*Port Bindings*
By default the microservice will start on port 7070. To set it to a different port use the following Maven properties:
```
-DtestServerHttpPort=9080 -DtestServerHttpsPort=9443
```

Note: if you run the package command with the 'liberty' profile the jar file will be called microservice-vote-liberty.jar.

=== Web Application (UI)

This starts the UI app and all services running in an embedded container.
The landing page is http://localhost:8080

.Console 1
----
mvn clean package tomee:run -pl :web-application -DskipTests
----

This starts a gulp task that monitors and updates changes to the static resources.

.Console 2
----
$ cd web-application
$ mvn frontend:gulp
----

Open a browser at http://localhost:8080/

== Common problems/bugs

=== NPM issues

The web-application project uses the *com.github.eirslett:frontend-maven-plugin* to download
and install all node and npm requirements.
Sometimes this may fail if console permissions are not permissive enough.

In such cases you will have to manually install some reqiurements:

<1> Download and install node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/

<2> Install npm manually:

----
cd web-application/src/main/static
npm install npm
npm install typings --global
typings install --global
----
