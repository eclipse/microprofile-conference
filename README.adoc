= Microprofile Showcase Application

== General information

The application consists of several Microservices and a Web-Application managing a conference :

* `microservice-schedule` : Schedule of the conference
* `microservice-session` : Sessions of the conference
* `microservice-speaker` : Speakers of the conference
* `microservice-vote` : Votes for each session
* `web-application` : Frontend Angular2 | Bootstrap4 | EE7 web application

== Technologies

* Java
* Micro Profile
* JAX-RS 2.0 / JSON-P 1.0 / CDI 1.1

== Development Build

----
mvn clean install -DskipTests
----

* Build the projects using Maven (`mvn clean install`) or (`mvn -fn clean install`) to skip over failed tests.
* To get the technical documentation, just `mvn clean generate-resources` under the `docs` directory. You will get a PDF and HTML version of the documentation under `docs/target/generated-docs`

=== Run Services

Each service can run on any container (this is the Microprofile guarantee),
but the service projects have been written by vendors to use their container.

The following sections describe vendor specifics:

==== `microservice-schedule`
The Schedule service is provided using a special microprofile release of link:http://www.payara.fish/payara_micro[Payara Micro] which can be downloaded from link:http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22payara-microprofile%22[Maven Central]

*Build and run the service*
When building the service Payara Microprofile packages both the war file and the microprofile runtime into a single UberJar for convenience.
```
cd microservice-schedule
mvn clean package
java -jar target/microservice-schedule.jar [Options]
```

*Port Bindings*
By default the microservice will bind to port 8080, if this is not available it will bind to the next available port e.g. 8081. To specify the port use --port as a command line option

To see a full set options run the jar with the --help command line option or see the link:https://payara.gitbooks.io/payara-server/content/documentation/payara-micro/payara-micro.html[Payara Micro Documentation] for a full list of options. 

==== `microservice-session`

Provided using link:http://wildfly-swarm.io[WildFly Swarm]

*Build and run the service*
```
cd microservice-session
mvn clean package
java -jar target/microservice-session-swarm.jar [-D<OPTION>]
```

*Address & Port Bindings*

=== Run the UI Web Application

This starts the UI app and all services running in an embedded container.
The landing page is http://localhost:8080

.Console 1
----
mvn clean package tomee:run -pl :web-application -DskipTests
----

This starts a gulp task that monitors and updates changes to the static resources.

.Console 2
----
$ cd web-application
$ mvn frontend:gulp
----

Open a browser at http://localhost:8080/

== Tests

mvn clean test

== Common problems/bugs

=== NPM issues

The web-application project uses the *com.github.eirslett:frontend-maven-plugin* to download
and install all node and npm requirements.
Sometimes this may fail if console permissions are not permissive enough.

In such cases you will have to manually install some reqiurements:

<1> Download and install node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/

<2> Install npm manually:

----
cd web-application/src/main/static
npm install npm
npm install typings --global
typings install --global
----
