= Microprofile Showcase Application

== General information

The application consists of several Microservices and a Web-Application managing a conference :

|=====

The WebApp is a direct subscriber to the individual Microservices.
This means that there is no aggregator / middle-man application.
The WebApp itself provides a known relative EndPoint microservice that enables the lookup of
URLs to the other services.

== Quickstart - Run all services and UI in separate runtimes

This will run each service in the runtime container that its setup for and the UI in a Node.js server to interact with them.

Build, package and run all microservices and the UI:
----
mvn clean package -P start,ui
----

Run just the microservices:
----
mvn package -Pstart -pl :microservice-start
----

Run just the UI:
----
mvn package -Pui -pl :microservice-start
----

=== Running on Liberty

To run all the services on individual WebSphere Liberty servers add the 'liberty' profile to the command:

----
mvn clean package -P start,ui,liberty
----

----
mvn package -P start,liberty -pl :microservice-start
----

== Development Build

----
mvn clean install -DskipTests
----

* Build the projects using Maven (`mvn clean install`) or (`mvn -fn clean install`) to skip over failed tests.
* To get the technical documentation, just `mvn clean generate-resources` under the `docs` directory.
You will find a PDF and HTML version of the documentation under `docs/target/generated-docs`

== Development Tests

----
mvn clean test
----

== Run Individual Services

Each service can run on any container (this is the Microprofile guarantee),
but the service projects have been written by vendors to use their container.  See the README.adoc of each microservice for details on how to run each microservice individually.

== Common problems/bugs

=== NPM issues

The web-application project uses the *com.github.eirslett:frontend-maven-plugin* to download
and install all node and npm requirements.
Sometimes this may fail if console permissions are not permissive enough.

In such cases you will have to manually install some reqiurements:

<1> Download and install node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/

<2> Install npm manually:

----
cd web-application/src/main/static
npm install npm
npm install typings --global
typings install --global
----
