= Microprofile Showcase Application

== General information

The application consists of several Microservices and a Web-Application managing a conference :

* `microservice-schedule` : Schedule of the conference
* `microservice-session` : Sessions of the conference
* `microservice-speaker` : Speakers of the conference
* `microservice-vote` : Votes for each session
* `web-application` : Frontend Angular2 | Bootstrap4

== Technologies

* Java
* Micro Profile
* JAX-RS 2.0 / JSON-P 1.0 / CDI 1.1

== Development Build

----
mvn clean install -DskipTests
----

* Build the projects using Maven (`mvn clean install`) or (`mvn -fn clean install`) to skip over failed tests.
* To get the technical documentation, just `mvn clean generate-resources` under the `docs` directory. You will get a PDF and HTML version of the documentation under `docs/target/generated-docs`

== Run Services

Each service can run on any container (this is the Microprofile guarantee),
but the service projects have been written by vendors to use their container.

The following sections describe vendor specifics:

=== microservice-schedule
The Schedule service is provided using a special microprofile release of link:http://www.payara.fish/payara_micro[Payara Micro] which can be downloaded from link:http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22payara-microprofile%22[Maven Central]

*Build and run the service*
When building the service Payara Microprofile packages both the war file and the microprofile runtime into a single UberJar for convenience.
```
cd microservice-schedule
mvn clean package
java -jar target/microservice-schedule.jar [Options]
```

*Port Bindings*
By default the microservice will bind to port 8080, if this is not available it will bind to the next available port e.g. 8081. To specify the port use --port as a command line option

Click on link:http://localhost:8080/microservice-schedule/schedule/1[http://localhost:8080/microservice-schedule/schedule/1]

To see a full set options run the jar with the --help command line option or see the link:https://payara.gitbooks.io/payara-server/content/documentation/payara-micro/payara-micro.html[Payara Micro Documentation] for a full list of options. 

==== JCache proposal

This is an example of using JCache to provide caching. 
Payara Micro includes hazelcast that provides distributed cache across all connected cluster members. It also provides means to pass messages using cache listeners (example is not provided yet). 

So far, the implementation relies on jcache-api provided by the runtime. CacheManager is created by a CDI producer when first needed, a cache is used to store data accessed by ScheduleDAO instead of a hashmap. Can easily be extended to cache persistence layer when persistence is added. Application behaves as behore, but the data can be replicated to more nodes if you run multiple nodes. Tested with Payara Micro.

To see how it works, run `microservice-schedule.jar` multiple times on the same machine:

```
java -jar target/microservice-schedule.jar [Options]
java -jar target/microservice-schedule.jar [Options]
java -jar target/microservice-schedule.jar [Options]
```

When multiple instances are running, use `ScheduleResource` REST endpoint to store some data using one of the nodes (e.g. at port 8080). Then restart the node. After restart, the very same data should be available, as they are retrieved from the other nodes in the cluster.

=== microservice-session

*Build and run the service*
```
cd microservice-session
mvn clean package
java -jar target/microservice-session-swarm.jar [-D<OPTION>]
```

*Address & Port Bindings*

.Session Service Options
|===
|Flag |Description| Default

| swarm.bind.address=<address>
| Interface to bind servers
| 0.0.0.0

| swarm.http.port=<port>
| Sets the port for the HTTP server
| 8080

*Build and run the service*
[source,sh]
----
cd microservice-speaker
cd microservice-speaker-web
mvn clean package
mvn tomee:exec [-D<OPTION>]
java -jar target/microservice-speaker-web-exec.jar

.Session Service Options
|===
|Flag |Description| Default

| tomee-plugin.http=<port>
| Sets the port for the HTTP server
| 8080

| tomee-plugin.ajp=<port>
| Sets the port for the AJP protocol
| 8009

=== microservice-vote
TBC

=== Run the UI Web Application

This starts the UI app and all services running in an embedded container.
The landing page is http://localhost:8080

.Console 1
----
mvn clean package tomee:run -pl :web-application -DskipTests
----

This starts a gulp task that monitors and updates changes to the static resources.

.Console 2
----
$ cd web-application
$ mvn frontend:gulp
----

Open a browser at http://localhost:8080/

== Tests

mvn clean test

== Common problems/bugs

=== NPM issues

The web-application project uses the *com.github.eirslett:frontend-maven-plugin* to download
and install all node and npm requirements.
Sometimes this may fail if console permissions are not permissive enough.

In such cases you will have to manually install some reqiurements:

<1> Download and install node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/

<2> Install npm manually:

----
cd web-application/src/main/static
npm install npm
npm install typings --global
typings install --global
----

== Notes

This application is a collaborative demonstration application by:

* Liberty Profile
* London Java Community
* Red Hat
* Tomitribe
* Payara
